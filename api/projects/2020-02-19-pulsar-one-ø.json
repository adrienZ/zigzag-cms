You are the chosen one who has to save the world.</p>\n\n<h3>Context</h3>\n\n  <p>During my 2nd year of school, we had to make a game. Our team wanted to make a storybook, during a trimester we worked on it while having other classes. We ended it up by getting the best grade of our promotion.</p>\n\n  <img src=\"src/media/img/post-img/pulsar/1.jpg\" alt=\"Pulsar's dark interface\">\n  <img src=\"src/media/img/post-img/pulsar/2.jpg\" alt=\"Pulsar's light interface\">\n\n<h3>Conception</h3>\n\n  <p>One of the hardest part of the project was to write a complete a non-linear story. Contrary to a linear story (begin, middle, end), the plot is connected between events, so the storyline is evolutive and adapt to the player's choices. You can also win rewards when doing certain actions.</p>\n\n  <img src=\"src/media/img/post-img/pulsar/3.jpg\" alt=\"non-linear story schema\">\n  <img src=\"src/media/img/post-img/pulsar/6.jpg\" alt=\"Pulsar's rewards\">\n\n<h3>Technical</h3>\n\n  <p>This is one my first project, I simply used raw HTML, CSS and Javascript (<b>a lot</b> of browser cookies).\n  <br>\n  In depth:</p>\n  <ul>\n    <li>Conditional rendering</li>\n    <li>Save game and checkpoints</li>\n    <li>HTML5 audio API</li>\n  </ul>\n\n  <img src=\"src/media/img/post-img/pulsar/4.jpg\" alt=\"Pulsar's character\">\n  <img src=\"src/media/img/post-img/pulsar/5.jpg\" alt=\"Pulsar's intro\">\n\n\n<h3>Conclusion</h3>\n  <p>We had a lot fun making this game !
