Indeed the e-commerce page wasn't very appealing, so they made a marketing campaign, offline and online.\n\n<iframe src=\"https://www.facebook.com/plugins/post.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fphoto.php%3Ffbid%3D10157913787213023%26set%3Da.14076638022%26type%3D3&width=500\" width=\"500\" height=\"378\" style=\"border:none;overflow:hidden; width: 500px; height: 378px; max-width: 100%; display: block; margin: auto;\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowTransparency=\"true\" allow=\"encrypted-media\"></iframe>\n\nIn less than a month, we have experimented several technologies and ideas until the client give us his blessing. The delivery went fine and they were very happy about the website which ended on the homepage of Devialet's website.\n\n![devialet immersif](/medias/devialet-0.jpg)\n\n![devialet dense](/medias/devialet-1.jpg)\n\n### Technical\n\n* We used component to reuse text types, buttons, containers, titles... all of this powered by <a href=\"https://github.com/brindille/brindille\">Brindille</a>\n* The apparition of elements on the scroll is handled by <a href=\"https://animejs.com/\">anime.js</a> timelines\n* The HTML templating is made with <a href=\"https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/\">Nunjucks</a> and <a href=\"http://stylus-lang.com/\">Stylus</a> for the CSS.\n\nThe client has chosen to keep simpler CSS effects on the 3 main words: Pure, Dense, Immersive...however, we had proposed a version with advanced WebGl effects, see for yourself:\n\n<video autoplay loop muted style=\"max-width: 540px\" src=\"src/media/img/post-img/devialet/2.mp4\"></video> <video autoplay loop muted style=\"max-width: 540px\" src=\"src/media/img/post-img/devialet/3.mp4\"></video>",
