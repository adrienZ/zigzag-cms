Earlier this week, I read[an article](https://calendar.perfplanet.com/2019/the-unseen-performance-costs-of-css-in-js-in-react-apps/)explaining how CSS-in-JS slows down the rendering of some React apps and how static CSS is faster. But CSS-in-JS is very popular because, among other features, you can style dynamically using JavaScript variables.

In this tutorial, I will show you how to recreate this perk in any of your web projects thanks to Webpack (and I assume you know how to use it). To start, we want Webpack to bundle our source files into a static`dist/`folder .

You can check out the[source code here](https://glitch.com/~shared-variables-webpack).

## 1. Set up our app

### The boring part

Create a folder for this tutorial, open your terminal, and init a project:

```

```

First things first, if it‚Äôs not already done, install[node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)and[Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/):

```

```

Let‚Äôs create a script in our`package.json`that tells Webpack to use our config file:

```json

```

At the root of your folder, create a`globals.js`file, where our shared variables will be stored:

```javascript

```

The Webpack config file looks like this (`webpack.config.js`). Create it at the root of your folder:

```javascript

```

Our source code will be located in an`app`folder. Create it like this:

```

```

You‚Äôll need`index.html`and`index.js`files at this point. Create those files in the`app`folder:

```

```

Perfect! You‚Äôre all set. üöÄ

Your folder should look like this:

```

```

## 2. Render our HTML files with the`html-webpack-plugin`

This`app/index.html`is empty. Let‚Äôs add some markup in it and then add a custom variable:

```html

```

As you can see, we are trying to print a variable in our HTML... which is impossible! To make it work we‚Äôll use the[html-webpack-plugin](https://github.com/jantimon/html-webpack-plugin)that gives us the ability to use[EJS](https://ejs.co/)syntax and**inject data into it**.

The plugin will generate a valid HTML file. In the meantime, you should rename your`app/index.html`file to`app/index.ejs`.

```

```

Let‚Äôs go back to our configuration file.`html-webpack-plugin`has an interesting`templateParameters`option that allows us to pass an object as parameter. Enable the plugin as follows in`webpack.config.js`:

```javascript

```

Run`npm run build`and*ta-daaaaa*¬´ <%= myTitle %> ¬ª became ¬´ Hello freeCodeCamp ¬ª ! The work is done by Webpack during the compilation when it runs the`html-webpack-plugin`.

See? This was pretty simple with the right tool: HTML ‚úÖ

## 3. Use our variables in JavaScript

Phew, so many lines just to print a variable! üò±With Webpack, things often get complicated. Well, this one is very simple: in JavaScript just import your file. In your`app/index.js`:

```javascript

```

This will print our globals object on the page. Now let‚Äôs move on to the CSS.

## 4. Use shared variables in our CSS

Here is our final boss üëæ

Okay guys you got me‚Ä¶ I lied. We can‚Äôt use our globals directly in CSS ‚Äì we must use a pre-processor. In this example, we will use[SASS](https://sass-lang.com/).

On the Webpack side, a plugin will not be enough. We must use a[loader](https://webpack.js.org/loaders/)to convert SASS into CSS. In this case we need the[sass-loader](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/sass-loader)package, so install it according to the docs:

```

```

Back to coding. Now that we have SASS, create your style sheet file,`app/style.scss`:

```scss

```

Our SASS is set up ‚Äì now how can we inject data into it? The`sass-loader`package has a[prependData](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/sass-loader#prependdata)option! But it takes a string as a parameter, which means that your data should look like this:`"$myColor: red; myTitle: '...'";`.

We have to automate that and convert a JavaScript object into a string. I didn‚Äôt find a package on`npm`that satisfied me, so I wrote[my own converter](https://gist.github.com/adrienZ/0257e37bf4788b903ba76fa82dac1ed1). Download the file and add it to your project (in my example it's`utils/jsToScss.js`).

Your final`webpack.config.js`should look like this:

```javascript

```

Here is what you should see:

If you are still reading this tutorial, thanks for your attention. I hope it helps you! Webpack is a very powerful tool you should dig more into üßê

NB: In your`dist/`folder you can see there isn't any CSS generated. That's because I use the`style-loader`to keep this demo simple. To generate the CSS file, take a look at the[mini-css-extract-plugin](https://webpack.js.org/plugins/mini-css-extract-plugin/).
